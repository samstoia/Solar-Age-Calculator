## | **Galactic Age Calculator Project** |

#### By Shawn Lunsford
###### Initiated March 22, 2019.

----------

## Description
A web application that allows a user to understand the different solar cycles (year lengths) of different planets.

## Known Bugs

* No known bugs.

## Specifications

    Determines how many years a user has left to live on each planet… (yikes!) To do this, the application will have to calculate the user’s life expectancy. You can determine average life expectancy as you see fit. A simple way to do this would be to have the user input the average life expectancy for their demographic. A more involved way to do this would be to collect other information from the user (e.g. lifestyle, country of residence, activity level, etc.) to determine their life expectancy.
    If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, return the number of years they have lived past the life expectancy.
    Return the date of a user’s next birthday on each planet.
    Return the age Keith Richards will be in dog years on the planet Jupiter in 2073.
    Assuming that the average lifespan of a mayfly is 5 minutes, determine how many mayfly lifespans a human user has lived and then compare it the current age (in Earth years) of our sun.
